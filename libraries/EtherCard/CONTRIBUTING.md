Contributing to EtherCard
=========================

Contributions to the EtherCard codebase are welcome using the usual Github pull request workflow.

Please remember that memory, particularly RAM, is often limited on Arduino, so try and be efficient when adding new features.


Code Style
----------

When making contributions, please use the following code style to keep the codebase consistent:

* Indent using *4 spaces* not tabs
* When placing an opening brace on the same line, there should be one space before it
* Closing braces should be broken from the preceding line

If in doubt, this is the same as the default [astyle] settings, so use the astyle tool to check your code.
